# Steps to optimize Ubuntu for better performance
- CLI : `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- make sure you have the minimum RAM for Ubuntu you installed (for example Ubuntu Gnome minimum RAM is 2 GB)
- remove unwanted apps || programs using `sudo apt remove <program name>`
- install __preload__ if it is not installed already. CLI : `sudo apt install preload`
- use SSD instead of HDD (if you want the best performance)
- LibreOffice : Tools > Options > enable **Systray Quickstarter**

Ubuntu Linux is already optimized enough! and Canonical continue optimizing it more alone with the COMMUNITY ‚ù§
